# A Developer Guide
A guide containing a list of developer programming languages, tools (including frameworks), and tutorials along with its URL and quick description.  

This is in progress...(that is, I just started this.)  

**DISCLAIMER:**  
This doesn't encompass everything on the Web, but tries to serve as a reference for me and those like me with limited spare time to play with code.  

**NOTE: Tools & Tutorials**  
Rarely do I ever see tools or tutorials that are not specific to a programming language. There are integrated development environments (IDEs) that are non-PL-specific, but even those usually specialize in a specific programming language like Eclipse (with Java) and Visual Studio (with C++, C#,VB and F#).  

Therefore, my developer's guide is organized into programming languages with exceptions for the following:
- web programming language standards: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS)
- machine learning (ML)
- artificial intelligence (AI)
